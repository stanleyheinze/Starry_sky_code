6. If you want to filter the data according to low/high r-values, enter threshold from 0 to 1

7. If you want to analyse the data until a certain timestamp (not the whole file), type in the timestamp. 1500 = 5 minutes.
   Sampling rate= 5Hz. 1500 samples / 5 samples per second = 300 seconds. 300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes.

8. Push green button until Figures open.
